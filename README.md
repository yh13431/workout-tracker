## About The Project

This application was created for users to track their own progress in the gym and share their workout routines with other users.


https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/7203a57b-c2d0-4306-b696-078f4c97ea64


Users must first log in, or register for an account if they do not have an existing one.


https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/e0bf4fa8-6c34-4035-a98a-fc0368bc085f

Upon registering for an account and logging in, users can view, create, update or delete their own routines. Users have a variety of muscle groups to choose from for categorisation.

Users can also save both their own and other users' routines.
