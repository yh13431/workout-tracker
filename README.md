## About The Project

This application was created for users to track their own progress and share their workout routines with other users.

![register-workout](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/9f0bfbbe-e12a-455d-8fe1-9f0cfbd004eb)
![login-workout](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/958508a1-6a19-43d3-9372-a2057824cf95)

Users must first log in, or register for an account if they do not have an existing one.

![homepage](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/6856e39e-e494-49b4-aeed-1d11c29ab653)
![add-routine](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/1b4a2065-d376-4a82-81dc-2c9734e75829)
![routine-single](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/72763bfe-991c-43ee-a51c-2d6bc3db2198)

Upon registering for an account and logging in, users can view, create, update or delete their own routines. Users have a variety of muscle groups to choose from for categorisation.

![add-exercise](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/3c614b69-f437-47e0-b0a9-9c14823f84b5)

In addition, users can view, create, update or delete exercises from their routines. Each exercise has its own customisable values (sets, reps, weight, etc.)

Users can also add photos to both their routines and exercises.

![homepage-logout](https://github.com/yh13431/workout-tracker/assets/106964833/cdad5b14-5188-4eef-bf3f-08652074e666)

Users can only edit their own routines and exercises.
